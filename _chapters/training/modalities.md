                <p>Music is a universal form of communication, self-expression, and joining with others.  This workshop focuses on the use of simple musical instruments as a therapeutic tool for emotional expression, contact with self/other, and attuned communication.   Based in the principles of Gestalt Play Therapy, attendees will learn how sound and music can bring deeper meaning and experience to the therapeutic encounters with children and adolescents.   Learn something new while strengthening your skills in using music and musical instruments.</p>
