                <p>In all professions throughout time, the relationship between student and mentor has been essential.  That relationship can take many forms related to power, authority, responsibility, growth, and competence. In a collaborative relationship both student and mentor grow and develop greater competence as they work together.</p>
                <p>Most of us supervise the way that we were supervised. This workshop will offer a fresh perspective on the relationship between the supervisee and the supervisor. Even though there will be play therapy techniques used in this workshop, the focus will be on building a collaborative the supervisory relationship in which both mentor and supervisee develop together as they collaborate on treatment issues. The collaborative mentoring relationship allows opportunities to work through the challenges and rewards of contact with diversity and other relational issues in the supervision. Similarities of supervision in agency and private practice settings and the different responsibilities of mentors in each will be addressed. We will take an enjoyable look at collaborative mentoring in fairytales and other childrenâ€™s stories. Participants are encouraged to read the Italian version of Pinocchio.</p>
