                <p>It is not uncommon for an adopted child’s grief to be unseen in therapy.  This workshop which is led by an a specialist in the therapy of foster families and adopted children (who herself is an adoptee) will focus on the many issues that become present in therapy, but especially how grief manifests in the behavior, emotions, and the beliefs of self.    The approach of Gestalt Play Therapy in this specialized area will be presented through research, theoretical perspective, and case presentation.</p>

                <p>The Advanced Intensive Training is planned for those wanting to continue with the work of the Basic Intensive and reunite with friends while doing so. The focus of the Advanced Training will be on Integrative processes such as working with children and adolescents on core issues of shame and disruptive beliefs about self and others and one’s place in the world.  These “introjects” shape the trajectory of a child’s life. The processes of self-nurturing and self-compassion and the writing of a life/trauma narrative can provide a foundation for healing and greater neural integration.  How to effectively use these processes in Gestalt Play Therapy with teens as well as younger children will be the focus of this four day training.</p>
