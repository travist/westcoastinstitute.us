                <hr/>
                <p>This advanced seminar is planned for those who have completed the Basic Training in Gestalt Play Therapy OR are interested in learning about the scientific, philosophical, and creative origins of Gestalt Therapy with children and adolescents. This course will delve into the original theoretical perspectives which evolved into the integrated, unifying system of Gestalt Therapy. The therapy process and use of treatment modalities in Gestalt Play Therapy will be experienced through the understanding of the psychological and philosophical principles of Gestalt Therapy. Focus will be on assessment, diagnosis, and treatment planning. A goal will be to connect the scientific and philosophical foundations of the original work in Gestalt Therapy to the science and philosophy of current neuroscience, attachment theory, and narrative therapy.</p>

                <p>The Advanced Intensive Training is planned for those wanting to continue with the work of the Basic Intensive and reunite with friends while doing so. The focus of the 2019 Advanced Training will be on Integrative processes such as working with children and adolescents on core issues of shame and disruptive beliefs about self and others and one’s place in the world.  These “introjects” shape the trajectory of a child’s life. The processes of self-nurturing and self-compassion and the writing of a life/trauma narrative can provide a foundation for healing and greater neural integration.  How to effectively use these processes in Gestalt Play Therapy with teens as well as younger children will be the focus of this four day training.</p>
