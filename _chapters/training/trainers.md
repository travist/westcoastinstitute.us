                <p>The 2019 Symposium was an international event and the focus was on updating our theory and training materials.   Gordon Wheeler, Ph. D. noted author and trainer who has contributed to Gestalt theory in child development and child clinical practice was the 2019 guest presenter.  In appreciation he received the first WCI Honorary Award as a Certified Gestalt Therapist with Children and Adolescents.   Violet Oaklander was contacted through SKYPE and each attendee spoke directly with her about how she had influenced their clinical work.    Another highlight was hearing from our colleague Anum Malik in Karachi, Pakistan about her training program with child therapists in Pakistan via SKYPE with Felicia Carroll.  The Symposium group enjoyed food, wine, countryside, and entertainment from the Santa Ynez Valley.</p>

                <p>The mission of the West Coast Institute is to provide to qualified professionals training and support in Gestalt Play Therapy with Children and Adolescents. The Certification Process offers those who want to develop a specialization in Gestalt Play Therapy with Children and Adolescents the structure and guidance in studying theory and applying the perspectives of Gestalt Play Therapy to work with their younger clients and their families WCI also provides in-depth training and inspiration to encourage those who are WCI Certified therapists and practitioners to provide competent training programs in their countries, vicinities, towns, and villages. We welcome the diversity, creativity, and aliveness this brings to all of us. A Trainers’ Symposium is held every two years. We gather together to share ideas for training programs and new play and expressive interventions. Those who attend build an international network of dynamic and committed colleagues.</p>
                <p>This symposium is offered to those who have attended the Intensive trainings or a full International program, and want support to become trainers in their own community/country.
