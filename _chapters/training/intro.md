                <p>The Introductory Workshop in Gestalt Play Therapy is designed to introduce the theoretical principles and clinical skills that distinguish Gestalt Play Therapy from other approaches.  This day is experiential which aims at integrating theory with practice while using the tools of expressive play therapy.  The emphasis of this program will be on individual psychotherapy and the application of Gestalt Therapy principles represented in the work of Violet Oaklander, Ph. D., author of Windows To Our Children and Hidden Treasure:  A Map to the Child’s Inner Self.  In this training we will examine closely those factors that bring about change and growth for a child or adolescent through the therapeutic process of Gestalt Play Therapy.  An emphasis in this work will be on the dynamics of the therapeutic relationship as the heart of play therapy.</p>
