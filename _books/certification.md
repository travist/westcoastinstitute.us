        <h3 class="header-sm-title">Supervision / Case Consultation</h3>
        <p>Supervision/Case Consultation can provide an opportunity to develop a foundation in Gestalt theoretical principles and methods for clinical practice. The Gestalt perspective emphasizes the nature of the relational elf and the qualities of the therapeutic alliance. Gestalt Therapy offers the child therapist an alternative way of working relationally and creatively with her young clients. Gestalt Therapy continues to influence the theory and practice of most contemporary schools in psychotherapy as well as challenge the aassumptions of others. The fundamental principles of Gestalt Therapy are confirmed by attachment theory, relational neurobiology and neuroscience. The integration of these recent developments with contemporary Gestalt Therapy shape the perspective of the supervisory/consulting discussion.</p>
        <p>There are currently over 20 participants in the Certification program of WCI.</p>
        <p>All faculty of WCI are available for supervision consultation through WCI. See <a href="/faculty">Faculty</a> tab.</p>
